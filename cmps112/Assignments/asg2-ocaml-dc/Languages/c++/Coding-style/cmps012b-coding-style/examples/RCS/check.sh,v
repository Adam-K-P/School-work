# NAME
#    check.sh - basic file format checks
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    check.sh [filename...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    Checks up on basic file formatting by expanding tabs to 8
#    character-stops and checking for a line length of <= 72
#    characters.  It prints out all lines longer than 72.
#    It then checks for any invisible characters by comparing
#    the visible display with the original file.  Tabs are
#    noted, except for a Makefile.
#
