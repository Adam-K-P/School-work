Makefile - Every program submitted must have a Makefile, spelled
	   *exactly* that way.

README   - Every program must have a README, containing your
	   name and username, and that of your partner (if any),
	   plus any specific note you want the grader to read.

PARTNER  - All partners should submit a file called PARTNER,
	   which contains the username of your partner.  Only
	   one partner submits the code.
