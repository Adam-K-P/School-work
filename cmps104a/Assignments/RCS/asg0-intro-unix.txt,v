@Asg0 - Introduction to Unix

It is assumed that everyone in class is familiar with Unix
(Linux), the UCSC submit command, and using Makefiles.

TAs should review the use of the Linux command line for those
few students who might not be familiar with it.  All programming
projects in this course will be done on the unix.ucsc.edu
servers or the workstations in BE/105.

Most students will, of course, develop on their own computers.
However, the production environment will be the Linux servers,
and all code must run there.

1. Use of the submit command.

All programs will be submitted via submit on the campus Linux hosts:

submit cmps104a-wm.f14 asg0 files...

Substitute for asg0 the names of later assignments.  Facilities
such as eCommons will not be used.

2. Accessing the command line from home.

ssh -X username@@unix.ucsc.edu

The option -X works if you are doing X11 forwarding.

3. Using make

Write a simple program in C++ using several modules, header
files, and separate compilation.  Write a Makefile that can
build it.

Submit the source code and Makefile as asg0.

While we will be using C++ in this course, all students are
expected to know C (prerequisite), and may use their own
discretion as to how much of C++ to use and how much just to
code in C.

Simplified, source code files should have the suffices .h or
.cpp, and we use g++ to compile source code.  It is recommended
that the containers from the STL be used instead of coding
containers yourself.

4. Not graded.

This assignment will not be graded.  There is no credit for it.
If the above interaction with Linux is not completely obvious,
attend the first couple of labs to be brought up to speed by
the TAs.
