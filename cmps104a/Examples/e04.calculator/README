This is a simple calculator with some arithmetic operations
having the usual priorities and a symbol table of one-letter
variable names.

It is an example of the use of bison and flex used to
generate an output file from test data.  It also illustrates
how to use a Makefile with bison, flex, and gcc.

This example is definitely overkill on the user of many
files.  However, each of the files present illustrate a part
of a compiler and their counterpart in your project will be
much larger.
